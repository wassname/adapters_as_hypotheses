# Abstract 

Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) has become ubiquitous to adapt foundation models to down-stream task requirements while retaining their generalization ability. However, the amount of additionally introduced parameters and compute for successful adaptation and hyperparameter searches can explode quickly, especially when deployed at scale to serve numerous individual requests. To ensure effective, parameter-efficient, and hyperparameter-robust adaptation, we pro-pose the ETHER transformation family, which performs E fficient fine T uning via H yp E rplane 

R eflections. By design, ETHER transformations require a minimal number of parameters , are less likely to deteriorate model performance , and ex-hibit robustness to hyperparameter and learn-ing rate choices . In particular, we introduce 

ETHER and its relaxation ETHER+ , which match or outperform existing PEFT methods with sig-nificantly fewer parameters ( ∼10 -100 times lower than LoRA or OFT) across multiple image syn-thesis and natural language tasks without exhaus-tive hyperparameter tuning . Finally, we investi-gate the recent emphasis on Hyperspherical En-ergy retention for adaptation and raise questions on its practical utility. The code is available at

# 1. Introduction 

Recently, large-scale foundation models (Bommasani et al., 2021) have demonstrated impressive general-purpose capabilities across both generative and discriminative tasks (Rombach et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023a; OpenAI, 2023; Kirillov et al., 2023), showing extensive flexibility

and strong performance when further adapted to different, more specialized tasks such as instruction following or con-trolled image synthesis (Zhang & Agrawala, 2023; Ruiz et al., 2022; Taori et al., 2023; Chiang et al., 2023). While impressive, these capabilities come with parameter counts increasing into the billions (OpenAI, 2023; Podell et al., 2023a; Touvron et al., 2023b). To allow for affordable and scalable model adaptation that can serve large and di-verse client bases, various techniques have been introduced in the literature. They range from full finetuning (Zhao et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2023a; Stojanovski et al., 2022) to just a few layers of the pretrained model (Kornblith et al., 2019), concatenating additional learning modules (Houlsby et al., 2019; Pfeiffer et al., 2020; Mou et al., 2023), and more re-cently to adapters on the network weights with lightweight learnable transformations (Qiu et al., 2023; Hu et al., 2022; Kopiczko et al., 2023; Valipour et al., 2023). The latter have proven particularly effective, introducing no inference la-tency, fewer adaptation parameters, and strong performance. Conceptually, these methods finetune on smaller datasets to adapt to downstream task and data requirements, without (1) compromising too much on the costly pretraining and (2) incurring concept and semantic drifts by catastrophically overwriting pretrained weights (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2019; Lu et al., 2020; Mehta et al., 2022; Ruiz et al., 2023; Ke et al., 2023; Roth et al., 2024; Garg et al., 2024; Ibrahim et al., 2024). Treading the line for a suitable trade-off between adaptation and retention of the founda-tional model capabilities thus presents itself as a difficult task to tackle, often requiring costly tuning of hyperparame-ters such as learning rates. This problem is acknowledged explicitly in Li et al. (2018); Chen et al. (2023a); Gouk et al. (2021) aiming to preserve Euclidean weight distances between pretrained and finetuned models, and implicitly with approaches opting for both lower learning rates (at the cost of more tuning iterations) and inclusion of tuning parameters via summation (Qiu et al., 2023). In particular, Qiu et al. (2023) hints that a Euclidean dis-tance measure likely fails to fully capture the preservation of the network’s ability, suggesting instead Hyperspherical En-ergy (HE) as an alternative measure. The resulting objective uses orthogonal transformations (OFT) for multiplicative weight changes that control HE. Still, even OFT requires 1

specific and restricted hyperparameter choices such as small learning rates and initialization from identity matrices to ensure sufficient knowledge preservation. In addition, while more robust and stable for finetuning in controllable gener-ation settings compared to LoRA (Qiu et al., 2023), OFT comes with a high computational overhead due to matrix multiplication and a large number of tuning parameters. In this work, we propose Efficient fine Tuning via 

Hyp Erplane Reflections ( ETHER ) - a new family of weight transformations, efficient in parameter count while preserv-ing model abilities and being robust in convergence and learning rate choices. By default, ETHER transformations frame the tuning process as a search for suitable hyperplanes, along which weight vectors can be reflected based on the or-thogonal Householder transformation (Householder, 1958). This keeps the distance to the transformation neutral ele-ment - the identity matrix - constant by construction and improves training stability while reducing the chance of deteriorating model performance. In addition, being built from single vectors, Householder transformations allow for efficient block-parallel matrix multiplication with minimal performance trade-offs. However, situations may arise where the hard distance restriction of ETHER can prove suboptimal (such as for subject-driven image generation, where finegrained subject-specific semantics need to be retained). As such, we aug-ment the ETHER family with ETHER+ - a relaxation on the default ETHER method. More precisely, ETHER+ de-rives from the Householder transformation, but breaks the orthogonality and constant distance constraints, introduc-ing multiple hyperplanes that can interact with a weight vector. As a result, ETHER+ allows for more controlled and finegrained adaptation, while still having a bounded distance to the transformation neutral element, and retaining the ETHER benefits of high parameter-efficiency, training stability, and hyperparameter robustness. Indeed, across subject-driven image generation, controlled image synthesis, natural language understanding and in-struction tuning tasks, we find that ETHER and especially 

ETHER+ match and outperform existing methods using only a few additional tuning parameters (e.g. 100 × less than OFT when finetuning Stable Diffusion for controlled image synthesis) - all while presenting stronger learning rate robustness compared to other methods and consequently re-quiring minimal hyperparameter tuning to achieve strong performance (c.f. Sec. 4). Finally, we also utilize our ex-perimental benchmark findings to further investigate and question the recent emphasis on transformation orthogo-nality and hyperspherical energy (HE) retention (e.g. Qiu et al. (2023)), showing how non-orthogonal ETHER+ can achieve strong performance while displaying increased HE. 

# 2. Related Work 

Parameter-Efficient Finetuning (PEFT). PEFT of pre-trained models has seen different strategies evolve in the past years - starting from finetuning protocols and concate-nation of learnable modules (Houlsby et al., 2019; Lester et al., 2021; Li & Liang, 2021; Pfeiffer et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2021) to more recently reparametrization of network weights with efficient transformations (Qiu et al., 2023; Hu et al., 2022; Kopiczko et al., 2023; Valipour et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023c). The latter have shown convincing trade-offs between adaptation quality, additional parameters, and inference latency. LoRA (Hu et al., 2022) transforms network weights by adding the result of a learnable, low-rank matrix product. On top of LoRA, multiple variations have been proposed, s.a. QLora (Dettmers et al., 2023) with quantized weights, AdaLoRA (Zhang et al., 2023c) with dynamic rank adjustment, and VeRA (Kopiczko et al., 2023) with low-rank frozen random projections and train-able vectors to reduce parameter counts. OFT (Qiu et al., 2023) instead learns matrix multiplier with orthogonality constraints to retain hyperspherical energy. In our work, we use the same paradigm but introduce hyperplane reflections for better parameter efficiency and learning rate robustness. 

Controlling Diffusion Generative Models. Diffusion-based generative models show strong compositional gener-ation (Rombach et al., 2022; Mukhopadhyay et al., 2023; Podell et al., 2023b; Karthik et al., 2023; Saharia et al., 2022). Among these, Gal et al. (2022); Ruiz et al. (2023) popularized personalized generation - teaching models to generate variations of user-provided samples. Based on DreamBooth (Ruiz et al., 2023), other works (Liu et al., 2023b; Richardson et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023e) fol-lowed. ControlNet (Zhang et al., 2023b) shows model controllability through external signals s.a. semantic and depth maps or face landmarks via extra layers at the cost of higher inference latency. Qiu et al. (2023) show con-trollability through direct finetuning with learnable matrix-multiplication transformations. Our work suggests an al-ternative, more robust and parameter-efficient approach through hyperplane reflections. 

Instruction Tuning Language Models. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown striking generalization across a wide range of tasks (Zhao et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023d; OpenAI, 2023; Touvron et al., 2023a). However, the default training objective often does not exactly match downstream task requirements and intentions. To address this mismatch, Instruction Tuning (Wang et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023d; Longpre et al.; Taori et al., 2023) finetunes LLMs using ad-ditional (Instruction, Output) pairs to explicitly align the model with human preferences. This enhances ca-pabilities and controllability while avoiding costly retraining (K ¨opf et al., 2023). Recently, methods based on LoRA (Hu 2ETHER : Efficient Finetuning of Large-Scale Models with Hyperplane Reflections 

et al., 2022) have been proposed to efficiently achieve this control (Dettmers et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b; Valipour et al., 2023; Kopiczko et al., 2023). This work proposes a strong alternative with further parameter-efficiency and high learning rate robustness. 

# 3. Method 

We first discuss adapter-based PEFT in §3.1, before de-scribing and motivating the use of hyperplane reflections in 

ETHER (§3.2). To encourage flexibility in trainable control and adaptation, we propose a simple, yet effective relaxation 

ETHER+ in §3.3. Finally, §3.4 describes block-diagonal 

ETHER for improved computational efficiency. 

3.1. Preliminaries Parameter-Efficient Finetuning with Adapters. The most commonly deployed form of PEFT with an adapter is Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA , Hu et al. (2022)). LoRA parametrizes a change of pretrained weights W as 

(W + BA )⊺x + b

where BA is the matrix product of two low-rank matrices, i.e. for W ∈ Rd×f , A ∈ Rd×r and B ∈ Rr×f . When rank r << min (d, f ), this can bring down required tuning parameters significantly compared to full finetuning. In addition, BA can be absorbed into W during inference to avoid additional latency. 

Orthogonal Finetuning (OFT). However, finetuning with LoRA can incur significant, potentially catastrophic weight changes. To ensure better preservation of pretrained model weights, Qiu et al. (2023) propose Orthogonal Fine-tuning (OFT). Based on the hypothesis that Hyperspherical Energy (HE) needs to be kept unaltered to preserve the original model abilities, OFT proposes the usage of multi-plicative orthogonal transformations on the model weights. By retaining pairwise weight angles, HE can remain un-affected. However, to work in practice, Qiu et al. (2023) require the construction of the orthogonal matrix Q via a Cayley parametrization Q = ( I + S)( I − S)−1, where S

is skew-symmetric. Notice that by using this parametriza-tion, they limit the range of possible orthogonal matrices to those with determinant 1, missing orthogonal matrices with determinant equal to −1. As we show, this is relevant, as it excludes reflections, which motivate ETHER . To make OFT more parameter efficient, the orthogonal matrix Q ∈ Rd×d

is built in a block-diagonal fashion, made up of n smaller blocks Qb of size dn × dn . The final OFT transformation on the forward pass can then be described as 

(QB W )⊺x + b

with block-diagonal QB . The trainable parameters are the n

matrices Qb ∈ R dn × dn that compose QB - more specifically the matrices Rb that build the skew-symmetric matrices 

Sb = 12 (Rb − (Rb)⊺) for Qb. For finetuning, the Rb are initialized as zero, such that QB |0 = I and consequently 

QB |0W = W at the beginning of finetuning. 

3.2. ETHER : Finetuning with Hyperplane Reflections 

Fundamentally, ETHER (Efficient fine Tuning via 

Hyp Erplane Reflections) sets up weight transformations as hyperplane reflections. These reflections can be obtained via the Householder transformation matrix H ∈ Rd×d with 

H = I − 2uu ⊺ (1) with u ∈ Rd the hyperplane unit normal vector and the corresponding outer product uu ⊺. The reflection can be easily intuited when applied to a weight vector w ∈ Rd:

Hw = ( I − 2uu ⊺)w = w − 2u(u⊺w).

Transformation H effectively subtracts twice the compo-nent of w projected on u, thereby reflecting it with respect to the hyperplane defined by u (see Fig. 1). By construc-tion, hyperplane reflections are well-suited for the efficient finetuning of pretrained models, as they keep the distance to the transformation neutral element - the identity matrix -constant, which minimizes the risk of divergence from the pretrained model and deterioration of model performance (c.f. Fig. 4). This can be easily shown by computing the Frobenius norm of the difference between the Householder matrix H and the identity matrix I: 

∥H − I∥F = ∥I − 2uu ⊺ − I∥F = 2 · ∥ uu ⊺∥F = 2 (2) The above equation leverages the fact that for any matrix M

∥M ∥F = pTr (M M ⊺)

and that with M = uu ⊺ and u having unit length u21 + u22 +

... + u2 

> d

= 1 , one can simply write (with (uu ⊺)⊺ = uu ⊺)

∥uu ⊺∥F =

qPdi=1 u2 

> i

= 1 .

Since the finetuning process simply consists of finding the optimal directions of the reflection hyperplanes with bounded deviations from the transformation neutral element, it allows for (i) a very low number of extra parameters cor-responding to the unit vectors u, and (ii) the usage of high learning rates, as the risk of divergence is minimized . This allows for general learning rate robustness and encourages fast convergence by default, as consistently high learning rates can be selected; reducing computational resources required to achieve good performance (e.g. Fig. 6). 3ETHER : Efficient Finetuning of Large-Scale Models with Hyperplane Reflections hyperplane  U

Figure 1. ETHER and ETHER+ sketches. We visualize either a single hyperplane reflection for ETHER or two interacting hyper-planes for ETHER+ , parametrized unit normals u (and v). Unlike 

ETHER , the final result of ETHER+ does not have to retain the original length L, as the need for hard reflections is softened, and orthogonality is no longer guaranteed. 

Interestingly, as this transformation is orthogonal ( HH ⊺ =

I), it falls under the umbrella of orthogonal transformations motivated in OFT (Qiu et al., 2023) from the perspective of Hyperspherical Energy control to better preserve model pre-training. However, OFT leverages the Cayley parametriza-tion of orthogonal matrices, which only produces determi-nant 1 matrices. By construction, this excludes Householder matrices from OFT, which have determinant −1! How-ever, as noted above, it is indeed in this particular setting and through the use of Householder transformations that high parameter efficiency, strong pretraining retention, and learning rate robustness arise. On top of that, we further investigate the importance of Hy-perspherical Energy retention by conducting a control study comparing OFT against its non-orthogonal variant ( Naive )1

Our experiments do not show significant differences in terms of control and training stability, suggesting that such proper-ties stem from the multiplicative finetuning approach rather than the underlying HE retention, contrasting insights in Qiu et al. (2023) (c.f. Sec. 5.3). These findings partly moti-vate the exploration of a relaxed variant of the Householder reflection in the next section 3.3, which demonstrates that loosening the orthogonality constraint not only maintains good performance but can even lead to enhanced results. 

3.3. Relaxing Orthogonality in ETHER 

While finetuning via hyperplane reflections has several promising qualities as highlighted above, there is no free lunch. In particular, situations may arise where the strength of the transformation and inherent deviation from the iden-

tity may be too large by default, such as for potentially more nuanced tasks like subject-driven generation (Ruiz et al., 2023). To allow for more nuanced transformations while retaining beneficial properties of ETHER - parame-ter efficiency and learning rate robustness through bounded deviations from the transformation neutral element - we propose the ETHER+ relaxation 

H+ = I − uu ⊺ + vv ⊺

with unit vectors u, v ∈ Rd. This is a simple variation of the Householder transformation that now allows for interaction between two distinct hyperplanes (see Fig. 1). This helps to control the transformation strength as uu ⊺ and vv ⊺ can weaken or even cancel each other out to return the identity transformation in the limit where u = v. In addition, the transformation distance remains bounded, as the relaxed variant H+ always has ∥H+ − I∥F ≤ 2, i.e. max H+ − I F ≤ max ∥H − I∥F .

This follows immediately from the triangle inequality of norms, i.e. ∥vv ⊺ − uu ⊺∥F ≤ ∥ vv ⊺∥F + ∥uu ⊺∥F = 2 . Due to the weaker strength of this new transformation, we apply it both on the left ( H+) and right ( ˜H+) of the weight matrix 

W , such that the forward pass becomes

x + b. 

Consequently, ETHER+ effectively leverages a sequence of hyperplane interactions that no longer have to retain length to allow for more nuanced weight adjustment while still minimizing the risk of diverging from the pretrained model (as also shown e.g. in Figs. 3, 4, 5 and 6). 

3.4. Efficient ETHER through Block-Parallelism 

In multiplicative finetuning like OFT or ETHER , further computational load is introduced through additional ma-trix multiplications. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a block-diagonal formulation of ETHER similar to block-diagonal OFT described in §3.1. For this, we break down the Householder transformation H (eq. 1) into its corresponding 4ETHER : Efficient Finetuning of Large-Scale Models with Hyperplane Reflections

with each i-th block-plane parameterized by ˆui ∈ R dn . Of course, one can do the same for H+. In both cases, such a block-diagonal formulation reduces the cost of comput-ing H. More importantly, each i-th block now only affects the corresponding i-th block-row in the weight matrix W .This means we can split W into n sub-blocks W i ∈ R dn ×f ,each of which is uniquely altered by its corresponding Hi

counterpart. As a result, the full weight transformation can now be separated into smaller block-specific operations, re-ducing the overall number of computations. Furthermore, these operations can now be fully block-parallelized, signif-icantly increasing training speed! In terms of computations, for each full-matrix-multiplication between H and W of sizes d×d and d×f respectively, d(df ) multiplications and 

(d−1) df additions are necessary, accounting for O(d2f ) op-erations. With our block-parallel scheme, we reduce these to n block-specific dn ( dn f ) multiplications and d−1

additions, resulting in O( d2fn ) operations (see Tab. 1). Furthermore, with each block being built from a single vec-tor of dimension dn , ETHER transformations’ construction ensures that the total number of trainable parameters re-mains constant for any n number of blocks. This stands in contrast to block-diagonal OFT, where the use of higher block counts was introduced to minimize the number of parameters while introducing noticeable decreases in adap-tation performance! Instead, for block-diagonal ETHER ,we find performance to be consistent over increasing block counts (see App. D), allowing for an improved computa-tional footprint with negligible performance decrease. original  OFT

Figure 3. Change in model behavior as a function of perturba-tion strength , i.e. distance between weight transformation and identity matrix. As ETHER and ETHER+ are upper-bounded in perturbation by construction, catastrophic deterioration of model performances is rarely encountered, and weight transformations remain controllable even for maximal deviations. For standard approaches, s.a. OFT, larger deviations from the identity matrix may occur during training and result in substantial divergence from the pretrained model. Notice also that by breaking orthogonality constraints in ETHER+ , both smaller and stronger semantic vari-ants can be learned. 

# 4. Intriguing Properties of ETHER 

This section investigates and highlights the bounded dis-tance and non-deteriorating nature of ETHER /ETHER+ in more detail while providing insights into its favorable learn-ing rate robustness and the reliable use of high learning rates for fast convergence. For completeness, we also report here comparisons with the unconstrained Naive method, to better show the impact of orthogonality as proposed by Qiu et al. (2023), and how our method provides much stronger ro-bustness. Finally, we include a discussion on the parameter efficiency. For all experiments in this section, please see §5.1 for relevant implementation details. 

Non-Deteriorating Nature. Because both ETHER and 

ETHER+ are upper-bounded in their possible perturbation over the pretrained weight matrices (as measured for ex-ample by the distance to the transformation neutral ele-ment, the identity matrix), finetuning with both methods will guarantee suitable results for most hyperparameter choices. This is easily visualized in Fig. 3 by looking at generation samples after perturbing Stable Diffusion with randomly sampled transformations for each approach - OFT, ETHER 

and ETHER+ - respectively. While ETHER uses a fixed-distance transformation (c.f. Eq. 2) that introduces a notice-able change (but still retaining semantics), ETHER+ can obtain both finegrained visual control as well as stronger se-mantic changes. Conversely, unbounded methods like OFT catastrophically deteriorate a model’s generative abilities as the perturbation strength increases. 5ETHER : Efficient Finetuning of Large-Scale Models with Hyperplane Reflections Transformation  Distance  Weights  Distance

Figure 4. Distances as a function of learning rates between trans-formation and identity matrix ( Transformation Distance ), and finetuned and pretrained weights ( Weights Distance ). Distances obtained for subject-driven generation finetuning at convergence (1200 iterations). Results show distances magnitudes higher and unbounded for non-ETHER methods in both cases as learning rates increase. 

This results in a much more controlled generation setting for ETHER and ETHER+ finetuning. This is also depicted quantitatively in Fig. 4, which shows distances between the learned transformation and the transformed weights (at con-vergence) to the identity matrix and the pretrained weights, respectively, as a function of the learning rate. As can be seen, larger learning rate values for OFT and Naive fine-tuning (OFT without orthogonality constraints) result in distances that are orders of magnitude higher than those of 

ETHER and ETHER+ , leading to catastrophic deterioration and model collapse (see Fig. 8 in App.). 

Learning Rate and Hyperparameter Robustness. Practi-cally, the non-deteriorating nature of ETHER and ETHER+ 

manifests in learning rate robustness during finetuning. As the risks of divergence and collapse are minimized, train-ing stability becomes much less dependent on the choice of learning rate. This is seen when evaluating performance (e.g. mIoU for controllable image synthesis in Fig. 5) and model convergence (Fig. 6) against learning rates. For non-ETHER 

methods, Fig. 5 shows significant performance drops for high learning rates, while Fig. 6 reveals fast convergence speeds for ETHER+ with learning rates covering multiple magnitudes, much more general than e.g. OFT. This means that not only can good performance be guaran-teed for most learning rate choices, but fast convergence as well, with competitive results already after the first epoch. Since ETHER also only introduces a single hyperparameter, the number of diagonal blocks, which marginally impacts performance (c.f. §3.4), ETHER methods become very at-tractive for practical usage, as the need for grid-search and cautious low learning rate training for good performance (c.f. §1) is reduced. mIoU  vs  Learning  Rate  FID  vs  Learning  Rate

This figure extends Fig. 5 and highlights in detail how only a learning rate of 10 −4 allows for optimal convergence in OFT and Naive, while for ETHER+ fastest conver-gence speeds are stably achieved across magnitudes. 

Parameter Efficiency. Finally, we provide a more detailed exploration on the parameter efficiency of ETHER -based methods. Let L be the number of finetuned layers, d and f

the respective weight dimensions for W ∈ Rd×f . Then the parameter complexity for OFT can be written as O( Ld 2 

> n

)

(Qiu et al., 2023) with n number of diagonal blocks 2. Sim-ilarly, for LoRA we get O(Lr (d + f )) , while for ETHER 

and ETHER+ we only have O(Ld ) and O(L(d+f )) respec-tively. With respect to both LoRA and OFT, this omits at the very least the rank multiplier r, or a potentially quadratic scaling. As already motivated in Sec. 3, this results in in-credibly efficient finetuning while achieving comparable or stronger performances. For example, when finetuning Sta-ble Diffusion as done above, ETHER and ETHER+ use 120 times and 30 times fewer parameters than OFT respectively.

Qiu et al. (2023) note a possible O(Ld ) if n = αd . However, in practice, equally scaling n with d disproportionally reduces adaptation parameters for large weight matrices. As OFT is fairly dependent on the parameter count, we omit this estimate.

# 5. Benchmark Experiments 

We first investigate generative model adaptation in Sec. 5.1, with a focus on subject-driven image synthesis (§5.1.1) and controllable image synthesis (§5.1.2) following recent works (Qiu et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023a). Sec. 5.2 then corre-spondingly investigates language model adaptation, looking at both natural language understanding (§5.2.1) and instruc-tion tuning (§5.2.2). Finally, we study the importance of orthogonality and hyperspherical energy on finetuning per-formance in Sec. 5.3. 

5.1. ETHER for Image-generative Model Adaptation 

For our experiments on diffusion-based generative models, we apply the finetuning methods on the pretrained Stable Diffusion-v1.5 (Rombach et al., 2022), following the setting from OFT (Qiu et al., 2023). Our experiments follow best practices and hyperparameter choices for each method. For implementation details, please refer to App. C. 5.1.1. S UBJECT -DRIVEN GENERATION 

We first deploy ETHER and ETHER+ on subject-driven generation following Ruiz et al. (2023); Qiu et al. (2023); finetuning the generative model for each of the 30 subjects and 25 prompts. For each combination, we generate four images, and measure image quality via a DINO (Caron et al., 2021) and a CLIP image encoder (Radford et al., 2021), text-prompt fidelity via a CLIP text encoder, and image diversity using LPIPS (Zhang et al., 2018). 

Quantitative Results. Results are shown in Tab. 2. On subject-driven generation, we find competitive performance for both image quality, text-prompt fidelity and image di-versity, particularly for ETHER+ (e.g. DINO and CLIP-I scores of 0.666 vs 0.652 and 0.8 vs 0.794 for OFT, respec-tively). Most importantly, we achieve this performance while only utilizing a fraction of tuning parameters; with 

ETHER+ only introducing 0.4M as compared to 11 .6M

by OFT. As hypothesized in Sec. 3, for nuanced finetuning, 

ETHER ’s transformation strength seems to be too high to retain key semantic concepts in subject-driven generation, falling short in image quality with respect to other methods (e.g. also qualitatively depicted in Fig 3), despite achieving strong image diversity and text-prompt fidelity. 5.1.2. C ONTROLLABLE IMAGE GENERATION 

This section applies ETHER for controllability of Stable Diffusion following Qiu et al. (2023) for the Semantic Map to Image (S2I) task on ADE20K (Zhou et al., 2018). We use the trainable encoder from ControlNet (Zhang et al., 2023b) for the control signal and perform finetuning on the Stable Diffusion weights only. We report a baseline with just the control signal encoder to highlight relative

gains through finetuning. Evaluations are performed on 2000 images generated from the validation set using mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) and accuracy of seman-tic maps over generated images using UperNet-101 (Xiao et al., 2018) pretrained on ADE20K. Finally, we measure the similarity between generated and original images via FID (Heusel et al., 2018). For OFT, we also test magnitude re-fitting (Qiu et al., 2023) for an additional epoch. 

Quantitative Results. Results are depicted in Tab. 3, and clearly demonstrate competitive control with both ETHER 

and ETHER+ . Unlike subject-driven image generation, we find that ETHER performs on the same level as OFT multi-plicative finetuning while using over 100 × fewer parame-ters (e.g. 24 .6 versus 24 .5 mIoU of OFT with 0.1M versus 

13 .2M parameters). Introducing magnitude re-fitting to OFT yields only limited gains while adding 0.2M parame-ters. Similar to Tab. 2 for subject-driven image generation, we find that for controllable image synthesis, the ETHER+ 

relaxation provides additional performance gains (e.g. 27 .3

vs 24 .5 mIoU and 68 .1 vs 62 .8 Acc against OFT). Taking into account the more robust (Fig. 5) and faster convergence (Fig. 6), this presents ETHER+ as a practically attractive finetuning alternative. 

5.2. ETHER for Language Models Adaptation 

To understand the applicability of the ETHER transforma-tion family in the language domain, we follow Liu et al. (2023a)’s and Hu et al. (2022)’s experimental setup. For fair comparisons, we run grid searches over the most relevant 7ETHER : Efficient Finetuning of Large-Scale Models with Hyperplane Reflections

achieve competitive performances across metrics while utilizing fewer parameters (up to a magnitude in the case of ETHER ) while also retaining all practical benefits such as learning rate robustness depicted e.g. in Sec. 4.

hyperparameters in common value ranges. For additional implementation details, please refer to App. C. 5.2.1. N ATURAL LANGUAGE UNDERSTANDING 

We begin by deploying ETHER and ETHER+ on the widely utilized (Devlin et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019; He et al., 2023; Kopiczko et al., 2023) GLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2018), finetuning a pretrained DeBERTaV3-base model (He et al., 2023) following Liu et al. (2023a), from which we report the baselines’ results. GLUE comprises various En-glish sentence understanding tasks, such as inference tasks (MNLI, QNLI, RTE), classification of sentiment (SST-2) or correct English grammatical structures (CoLA), and seman-tic similarity and equivalence prediction (MRPC, QQP, STS-B). CoLA scores report the Matthews correlation coefficient, MNLI matched accuracy, and STS-B average correlation. All other tasks are evaluated on accuracy. 

Quantitative Results. Results in Tab. 4 show that ETHER 

and ETHER+ match and even outperform previous methods with significantly fewer parameters. For example, ETHER 

outperforms the second-best BOFT on the RTE inference task ( 89 .53 vs 88 .81 ) or equivalence prediction on MRPC (93 .68 vs 92 .40 ) while using just one-ninth of the param-eters ( 0.085 M compared to 0.75 M ). ETHER+ sets both the best performance on STS-B and particularly the highest overall score ( 90 .10 ) using less than half of the parameters of BOFT. These results provide additional support for the practical viability of ETHER transformations, now for nat-ural language adaptation - being a strong, but much more parameter-efficient competitor. 5.2.2. I NSTRUCTION TUNING 

Our instruction tuning experiments make use of Llama-2-7B (Touvron et al., 2023b) as pretrained model, finetun-ing it on the Alpaca dataset (Taori et al., 2023) for one 

Table 5. Instruction Tuning. We use r to denote rank, and n the number of diagonal blocks. Both ETHER and ETHER+ outper-form LoRA/OFT which use up to a magnitude more parameters, and beat VeRA with similar parameter counts.

epoch. To operate on a consumer GPU, we truncate the maximum sequence length to 256 and use bfloat16 precision (Kalamkar et al., 2019). We evaluate 0-shot performance of our instruction-tuned model on (i) Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) (Hendrycks et al., 2021) with 57 different tasks in four different subjects (STEM, Humanities, Social Sciences, Others); (ii) the AI2 Reason-ing Challenge (ARC) (Clark et al., 2018), a common-sense reasoning dataset of questions from science grade exams; (iii) TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022) comprising 817 ques-tions spanning 38 categories testing how much the model (wrongly) relies on imitation of human text to answer. 

Quantitative Results. Results in Tab. 5 show that both 

ETHER and ETHER+ outperform comparable finetuning approaches while utilizing fewer parameters. Across all metrics, the Llama-2-7B baseline is consistently surpassed by significant margins (e.g. 44 .87 MMLU for ETHER+ 

vs the 41 .81 baseline, or 46 .50 vs 42 .92 ARC score). De-spite being the most parameter-efficient method, ETHER 

outperforms all baselines with comparable number of pa-rameters, such as the recently introduced VeRA (Kopiczko et al., 2023) with rank r = 64 , and LoRA rank 1. Surpris-ingly, increasing the rank of VeRA to 256 leads to a decrease in performance, while LoRA rank 8 shows better results but is still outperformed on MMLU despite having 16 × more parameters. On the other hand, ETHER+ surpasses all other methods across all benchmarks, while having 4× fewer parameters than LoRA rank 8.

5.3. Hyperspherical Energy for Effective PEFT 

Qiu et al. (2023) link finetuning stability and perfor-mance obtained by transforming the weights via matrix-multiplication to the orthogonality of the transformations, and a consequently unaltered hyperspherical energy (HE). To test this assumption, we have included an OFT control baseline ( Naive ), which does not utilize orthogonality con-straints, on the same finetuning settings in which OFT was proposed. Results at convergence, as reported in Tab. 6, do not show significant differences, while actually introduc-8ETHER : Efficient Finetuning of Large-Scale Models with Hyperplane Reflections ΔHE  in  Subject-driven  Gen.

ing the overhead of computing the Cayley parametrizations (which also involve computing the inverse of a matrix). We also included the Naive baseline in the learning rate robust-ness studies in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, showcasing that while differences are present for high learning rates, the optimal working range remains unaltered. Finally, we validate that the HE indeed varies during training, as reported in Fig. 7. In contrast, on these same evaluations, our newly proposed 

ETHER transformation family, by introducing a bound-ary on the Euclidean distance on the transformation side, achieves stronger performance and greater robustness. This is especially true for the non-orthogonal ETHER+ , which alters the overall HE even more than Naive (Fig. 7). This evidence diminishes the role of the HE and instead em-phasizes the greater importance of the Euclidean distance, establishing the ETHER family as a favorable option in multiplicative finetuning settings. 

# 6. Conclusions 

Our paper introduces the ETHER family of transformations for parameter-efficient finetuning. Based on the House-holder formulation of hyperplane reflections, ETHER meth-ods frame finetuning as a search for unit normal vectors that define hyperplanes along which weight vectors are reflected. In doing so, ETHER (and its relaxation ETHER+ for more finegrained adaptation) fix (or upper bound) the distance of learned transformations from the identity matrix (the trans-formation neutral element), thereby minimizing the risk of finetuning divergence. Put together, ETHER methods operate more parameter-efficiently than other PEFT meth-ods (e.g., around 10-100 times less than LoRA or OFT), have higher learning rate robustness and encourage fast convergence. Consequently, ETHER transformations re-quire less expansive hyperparameter searches to achieve good performance, making them very attractive for practical deployment. 

Limitations. Of course, there is no free lunch. While both 

ETHER and its relaxation ETHER+ show strong results with few parameters across a broad range of tasks, increas-ing the expressive power of the transformation is not as straightforward as in other methods, such as LoRA, where one can adjust the rank parameter to more closely approx-imate full finetuning. Moreover, multiplicative methods introduce a computational overhead during training com-pared to additive methods. Thanks to our block-parallel scheme, we make significant progress towards closing the gap between multiplicative and additive approaches; how-ever, multiplicative methods still lag behind. This introduces a trade-off between parameter efficiency and computational overhead when achieving similar performance levels. 

# Impact Statement 

This paper presents work that looks into better and more effi-cient finetuning of foundation models. By bringing down the need for compute-expensive hyperparameter grid searches and encouraging fast convergence, both the cost and envi-ronmental footprint of serving individually adapted models at scale can be brought down. Of course, with most advance-ment in the field of Machine Learning, there is potential for misuse and societal consequences, however, none of which we feel are specific to our proposed method and which need to be highlighted explicitly.

# Appendix 

In this appendix, we augment the main paper with additional, qualitative evidence for the learning rate robustness of ETHER 

transformations in Appendix A. In addition, we also provide benchmark-specific qualitative examples for subject-driven and controllable image generation in Appendix B. For all experiments - both those in the main paper and supplementary results, we then list all relevant details in Appendix C for our studies on finetuning in subject-driven image generation (§C.1), controllable image synthesis (§C.2), natural language understanding tasks (§C.3) and instruction tuning (§C.4). We then provide two additional ETHER ablations in Appendix D - for the number of block-diagonals and the specific double-sided application in ETHER+ . Finally, we present preliminary results on the Visual Task Adaptation Benchmark (§E). 

# A. Qualitative Evidence of Learning Rate Robustness 

As introduced in Sec. 3, when finetuning with ETHER transformation, by construction, the learning rate only controls the speed with which reflection angels change. As a consequence, ETHER methods are much more robust to learning rate choices, and less likely to diverge and cause model deterioration. This allows for user control over the convergence speed while minimizing the risk of model collapse during training. To demonstrate this, Sec. 4 introduced both a qualitative example comparing the impact of minimal and maximal perturbation strength on the model output in Fig. 3, and quantitative evaluations on the Semantic Map to Image task against learning rate choices in Figs. 5 and 6. In this section, we augment Sec. 4 and provide additional qualitative results and impressions to highlight the non-deteriorating nature of ETHER transformation. For this, we showcase subject-driven generation results using different finetuning methods in Fig. 8, with default generations using the best learning rate. We then systematically increase the finetuning learning rate by 10 and by 100 times, and visualize the correspondingly generated output. As can be seen, for 10 × higher learning rates OFT and Naive fail to follow the text prompt, while LoRA finetuning quickly collapses. With 10 × lower learning rates instead, OFT, Naive and ETHER are not able to generate the subject correctly in the predefined number of iterations. "a [V] vase with a mountain in

> Figure 8. Qualitative visualization of learning rate robustness of ETHER and ETHER+ in subject-driven generation finetuning. We see how ETHER methods are able to consistently produce good results avoiding model deterioration. Specifically, ETHER+ shows impressive capabilities, being able to follow the subject-prompt instructions in the widest learning rate range.

# B. Qualitative Examples for ETHER Finetuning 

We show some qualitative results by using the finetuning methods proposed in this paper. 

B.1. Subject-driven Generation. 

In Figure 9 we report subject-driven generation examples. In particular, for a fair comparison, we report images which come from the same noise vector in the Stable Diffusion latent space. For the sunglasses images, we see how non-ETHER 

methods manage to reproduce the subject, but fail to follow the text prompt in most cases. Interestingly in the first row, we notice how ETHER+ is able to properly control the generation, by transforming the yellow area (associated to a beer in other models) in an enlightened Eiffel Tower. For the teapot images instead, we see how ETHER+ is able to better keep the appearances of the subject. ETHER+ LoRA  OFT  Naive

Figure 9. Subject-driven Generation results. Each row shares initial latent noise (notice row-wise similarities). We can see that ETHER+ 

method is better at adapting the model to the subjects. Notice how for the pink sunglasses, OFT and Naive fail in following the prompt.

B.2. Controllable Generation. 

In Figure 10 we show some examples from the Semantic Map to Image task. In particular, we notice how in the first row all models but ETHER+ fail to control the image correctly, not being able to separate the land from the water. Additionally, in the second row OFT fails to generate the sky, while Naive presents a halo effect. These examples showcase the abilities of 

ETHER+ finetuning over the other methods. "a lighthouse"

To show broader controllable capabilities, we also report few qualitative examples with ETHER methods trained with Landmarks and Canny Edge Maps control signals on CelebA-HQ (Karras et al., 2018) and COCO 2017 (Lin et al., 2015) datasets respectively.

# C. Experimental Details 

This section provides additional experimental details for replication not listed in the main benchmark experimental section 5. It is worth noting that while in most of our experiments we do not employ regular dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014), Liu et al. (2023a) proposes a multiplicative dropout form specifically designed for multiplicative finetuning methods, which we did not test in this study. We hypothesize that this specialized dropout technique could potentially work better than regular dropout for ETHER and ETHER+ as well. We also note that Qiu et al. (2023) report OFT’s number of parameters as half of the actual trainable parameters due to the redundancy in the skew symmetric matrices SB in the Cayley parametrization of 

QB . Basically, we they report the storage parameters for QB rather than the training parameters. For consistency and fair comparisons, we follow the same convention for OFT throughout our paper. 

C.1. Subject-driven Generation 

For subject-driven generation, we follow the same setting listed in DreamBooth (Ruiz et al., 2023), using DreamBooth and OFT (Qiu et al., 2023) baselines as implemented in official OFT GitHub repository. The additional trainable layers follow (Qiu et al., 2023) and are added to the Q,K,V layers and the projection layer inside every attention module. The training is performed over 1400 iterations for each method, evaluating the generation results every 200 iterations at selecting the best one (typically around 1200 iterations). For DreamBooth and OFT, we follow the original implementations and use a learning rate of 5 × 10 −6 and 6 × 10 −5 respectively, with a batch size of 1. For Naive - the non-orthogonal OFT variant -we use the same setting of OFT for a fair comparison. For LoRA we select a learning rate of 6 × 10 −4. For ETHER and 

ETHER+ , we use a learning rate of 6 × 10 −3. We perform the training on a Tesla V100-32GB GPU. 

C.2. Controllable Generation 

For our experiments on controllable image generation we follow the setting of Qiu et al. (2023), using the signal encoder from ControlNet (Zhang & Agrawala, 2023) (comprising 8 trainable convolutional layers, accounting for 3.1M additional learnable parameters). Finetuning parameters are added to the Q,K,V layers as well as the projection layer of the attention modules and the subsequent feedforward layers. As baselines, we use the official implementation of OFT. Similarly to Qiu et al. (2023), for OFT and Naive we use a learning rate of 1 × 10 −5. For ETHER and ETHER+ we use a larger learning rate of 1 × 10 −3. For all experiments, we upper bound the learning rate of the signal encoder to 1 × 10 −4. We perform all the training runs on a single Nvidia-A100-40GB with a batch size of 10. As listed in Sec. 5.1.2 and expanded in Sec. ?? , we tried to utilize LoRA for controllable generation as well but found no comparable results even after extensive trials with different hyperparameters. 

C.3. Natural Language Understanding 

For our GLUE benchmark experiments finetuning DeBERTaV3-base (He et al., 2023), we make use of the peft Hugging Face repository (Mangrulkar et al., 2022) as the basis for our implementations. To compare our results with those of Liu et al. (2023a), we follow their implementation and apply ETHER and ETHER+ to all the linear layers in every transformer block. The relevant hyperparameters for each task are reported in Tab. 8. All training runs are conducted on a single Nvidia-A100-40GB GPU.

C.4. Instruction Tuning 

For our Instruction Tuning experiments, we use the LoRA (Hu et al., 2022) finetuning implementation in the lit-gpt repository (AI, 2023) as baseline. For evaluations, we make use of Gao et al. (2023)’s benchmark implementations. For the recently proposed VeRA (Kopiczko et al., 2023) baseline, we reproduce the model implementation following their best performing method as described in the paper: sampling random A and B matrices with uniform kaiming initialization scaled by the matrix dimension, and a learnable, non-zero diagonalized vector initialized as a vector of all zeros apart for one element equal to 0.1. Same for OFT, for which we follow the implementation in the official repository oft, selecting the number of block-diagonal matrices such that the overall number of parameters becomes comparable with ETHER+ and LoRA rank 8. For all experiments, we use a cosine annealing learning rate scheduler, no dropout, and 1000 warmup steps. For LoRA, VeRA, and OFT we use AdamW optimizer with a weight decay of 0.01, while for ETHER methods, given the normalization happening on the parameters, weight decay would have limited impact and thus we set it to 0. For LoRA and VeRA, we keep α fixed with respect to the learning rate by setting it equal to the rank. For all experiments, we conduct an extensive grid search over learning rates and batch sizes. For each combination, we perform the LLama-2-7B (Touvron et al., 2023b) finetuning over Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023) for one epoch. All training runs are conducted on a single Nvidia-A100-40GB GPU, but could also be run on a consumer NVIDIA GeForce-RTX-3090-24G GPU.

This section details additional ablation experiments on the impact of the block-diagonality degree on the final performance, as well as experimental support to the theoretical motivation in Sec. 3.3 to apply the relaxed Householder transformation on both the left and right side of the weight matrix. 

D.1. Block-diagonal ETHER Performances 

In Table 9 and Table 10, we compare the usage of multiple diagonal blocks for ETHER finetuning to allow for fast performance, especially in large models domain. Both tables augment our method description in Sec. 3.4 and the shortened results in Tab. 1. In all cases, we notice that performance remains almost unaffected by the choice of block number, while on the other hand, the computational efficiency consistently increases ( 8.22 TFLOPs for n = 32 versus 25 .26 TFLOPs for 

n = 1 for Llama-2-7B). It is worth noting that results for ETHER+ with n = 32 show better performance with respect to less diagonalized counterparts.

D.2. Double-sided Application of ETHER+ 

Finally, we provide a brief ablation study in Tab. 11, comparing the ETHER+ performance when applying the relaxed Householder transformations H+ on only one side versus both sides. Although the parameter count doubles, we observe a significant increase in performance (e.g. 0.666 vs 0.618 in DINO score) as higher transformation distances can be achieved.

ETHER+ 0.4M 0.666 0.800 

# E. VTAB preliminary results 

We also perform a small evaluation over a subset of the popular Visual Task Adaptation Benchmark (VTAB), using an ImageNet-21k pretrained ViT-B. As can be seen, ETHER and ETHER+ perform comparably to OFT with n = 256 and LoRA rank 8, while using a fraction of the trainable parameters.
